# Ionosphere_ML
We have implemented algorithms such as random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting and SVM with different kernels for prediction of "Good" or "Bad" Radar Signals.
This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador. This system consists of a phased
array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.
The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "Good" radar returns are those showing evidence
of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "Bad" returns are those that do not; their signals pass
through the ionosphere.
